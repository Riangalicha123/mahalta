LavaLust Version 3

# Changelog

1. Remove xss_clean() using Escaper class. If you want to use it, install htmlpurifier library then
create a function "xss_clean" inside a helper.
2. You can now use different instances of database connections. Changes also affect
the database.php file inside the config folder. (Every instances depends on the key of database array
variable.)
    $this->call->database();
        * This will enable $this->db variable to handle queries.
    $this->call->database('other_connection');
        * This will open new connection based on the parameter "other_connection". You will
        need to create new index in database array named "other_connection" inside database.php
        file. It will enable $this->other_connection to handle queries.
3. Inside view fie, if you pass $data variable from controller, you can easily use the array key of
it inside the view.
    Example: Controller
        function index() {
            $this->call->model('user_model');
            $data['users] = $this->user_model->get_all_users();
            $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
        }
        Inside view file you can extract values of $data['users] by just using its key "users"
        Example: View
            foreach($users as $user) {
                echo $user['some_index'];
            }
        Moreover, you can also pass a plain string to view file.
        Example:
            function index() {
            $this->call->model('user_model');
            $data = "This is a string.";
            $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
        }
4. In models, you dont't need to add exec() method in insert(), update() and delete() because Lavalust
        automatically added it for you.
    Example: model
            $this->db->insert($bind)
5. You can now use put models inside sub directories.
    Example: model/sub_dir/Sample_model.php
            $thi->call->model('sub_dir/sample');
            $this->sample->method();
6. You can now use http verb in routes. Just add the type of request after the route
    Example: $route['delete/:num']['delete'] = 'welcome/delete/$1';
    See docs for more info.
# Todo
## Clean the scheme folder files.

LavaLust Version 2

# Changelog

## Security
To access your index file from public folder, put index.php inside it and change the ff:
1. ROOT_DIR should be dirname(__DIR__);
2. add .htaccess file inside your root directly
    AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    # Route all other requests
    RewriteRule ^(.*) public/$1 [L]
    </IfModule>
3. add .htaccess file inside your public folder
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [QSA,L]
    </IfModule>

## Update url_helper
Add exit option as 4th parameter of the function

## Optional usage of mod_rewrite
You can remove the .htaccess file and access the url like http://website.com/index.php/controller/model/args
If you want to use the previous way like http://website.com/index.php/controller/model/args, rename the htaccess.example
to .htaccess only.

## Fixed Cookie samesite error in PHP version < 7.3
set_cookie($name, $value, $expiration, array())

## Fixed Session Class / flashdata() problem wiht PHP 8. [2.0.4]

## Update model methods inside controller. [2.0.4]

If you are using version <= 2.0.3 you will need to update every calls on your model.
Before, you are creating model like class Example_model{} and load it using $this->call->model('example')

Now model method has a second optional parameter which is the object name you want to use aside
from the class name itself. So if you have something like class Example_model {}, you can now call it using
$this->call->model('example_model', 'example'). Then if you are going to use it, just use $this->example->some_method().
You can also use array to load methods by using key & value. Example $this->call->model(array('key' => 'value'))
which is key is the new object name you want to use and value is the actual class name.

Regular usage now is class My_model {}, $this->call->model('my_model')

To easily migrate from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 change all instances of $this->call->model() to the
example with second parameter. So if you have class Example_model {} before and you call it this way
$this->call->model('example') now you shoul do something like this $this->call->model('example_model', 'example')

## Add Pagination Class [2.0.3]

## ->exec() was added again for some technical reasons [2.0.2]

## No need to add Database.php ->exec() method in insert, update and delete [2.0.1]

## Added option to use query string [2.0.0] 2021-03-30
